# Hi I am Jamaalullah!

I am a third year mechanical engineering at the University of Auckand. This is a portfolio that which showcases the projects I have completed. I have a keen interest in mechanical design, analysis and manufacturing processes.

## Technical skills 

CAD: Autodesk Inventor <br>
Programming: C, MATLAB <br>
Manufacturing: 3D printing, CNC machining, Welding, Soldering <br>
Analysis: SIMULINK, Mechanical force calculations based on mechanics of solids, materials and machine principles.

## Featured Projects

### 🦾 Robotic helper arm (Personal Project)
- Designed a 3D model of a mechanical robotic arm.
- Calculate forces and types of stabilishing methods.
